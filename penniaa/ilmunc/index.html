					<h1 id="about-china"> About ILMUNC China </h1>
					<p> The Ivy League Model United Nations Conference - China (ILMUNC China) is the first of the IAA's international endeavors. ILMUNC China participates annually in WEMUN Expo and became an independent conference in 2012. Since then, ILMUNC China has repeatedly served as a great introduction to the world of Model UN for new delegates while still providing a competitive experience for those students who have debated before. Together, IAA members as directors and Chinese high school students as delegates collaborate to foster international cooperation, encourage cross-cultural understanding, and provide the tools for diplomacy. </p>

					<p> The third session of ILMUNC China will be held in Guangzhou, China from Sunday, December 29, 2012 to Wednesday, January 1, 2013 and looks forward to the participation of high school students from all around the world. </p>
